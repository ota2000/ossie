# OSI Compliance Test Suite — Foundation

**Targets the
[Ossie Semantic Foundation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bEuIb2eUpwesi6cIZ5FOkXMQDh7KAPIjZsWchmLgOAk/edit?usp=sharing) proposal
[`SQL_EXPRESSION_SUBSET`](../core-spec/expression_language.md)**

The Foundation is the deliberately narrow first-cut of Ossie semantics:
two query shapes, implicit home-grain aggregation, window functions,
and a small deferred-features list — pinned by numbered Conformance
Decisions (D-NNN) throughout the Foundation spec, and an error code
index in its appendix.

The runner harness lives at [`../harness/`](../harness/) and is
shared with every future per-version suite under `compliance/`.

## Status of this slice

This is a **bootstrap slice**, not the full suite. It ports over just
enough of the compliance suite to make the mechanism (test discovery,
metadata schema, decision-coverage tracking, DuckDB-backed row
comparison, reporting) runnable and testable end to end:

- **Tests present:** `tests/cross_grain/moderate/` only — 4 cases
  (`t-005a`, `t-005b`, `t-005d`, `t-005e`) covering D-020 (single-step
  cross-grain aggregation over a `1 : N` edge). Every other area listed
  under `Layout` below (query shape, bridge/M:N, windows, namespace,
  etc.) is the *target* design carried over from the source proposal
  and will land — with its own tests — in follow-up PRs.
- **No adapter yet.** `adapters/osi_python_adapter.py` delegates to
  `impl/python/conformance/adapter.py`, which does not exist in this
  repo yet (`impl/python/` is still a placeholder). Until an
  implementation lands, `python -m harness.runner --list` is the way
  to exercise this suite — it discovers and validates the test corpus
  without needing an engine. The 4 included tests carry
  `status: planned` in their `metadata.yaml` (matching their status in
  the source proposal — the semantics they pin are accepted but not
  yet required-to-pass), so a full `harness.runner` run against a
  partial adapter will correctly skip them unless invoked with
  `--include-planned`.
- **`decisions.yaml`** keeps every `D-NNN` row from the source
  proposal (so `harness`'s own registry-consistency tests still pass),
  but only `D-020` has a populated `tests:` list — every other
  decision's `tests:` is intentionally empty pending its witness
  tests landing in a later PR.
- **Dropped `T-024`.** The source proposal's compliance suite also
  shipped `tests/cross_grain/moderate/t-024-boolean-home-grain-scalar-in-where/`.
  It was excluded from this slice: its `gold.sql` filters on
  `customers.segment = 'PREMIUM'`, a value that does not exist in the
  `f_prelude` fixture (segments are `retail` / `wholesale`), so the
  query returns zero rows — and the test as implemented doesn't
  exercise the aggregate-derived boolean-field case that
  `DATA_TESTS.md` §4.G documents for T-024 (`has_completed_orders`,
  an aggregate `COUNT(...) > 0` field routed through `Where`). See
  the PR description for the full writeup; worth fixing at the
  source before it's re-added here.

## Layout

```
compliance/foundation-v0.1/
  README.md                     # this file
  SPEC.md                       # the specs this suite targets (Foundation v0.1)
  pyproject.toml                # editable install; depends on ../harness (osi_compliance_harness)
  conformance.yaml              # test conformance levels; "foundation_v0_1" = required
  proposals.yaml                # mirrors §10 of the Foundation spec; every deferred is a proposal
  decisions.yaml                # D-NNN registry with anchor + status; tests: populated only for D-020 in this slice
  adapters/
    osi_python_adapter.py       # delegates to impl/python/conformance/adapter.py (not yet present)
  datasets/
    f_prelude/                  # mirrors DATA_TESTS.md §3.1 — the only fixture this slice needs
  tests/
    cross_grain/                # T-005a/b/d/e (D-020) — the only populated area in this slice
  results/                      # created by the runner (gitignored); no committed baseline yet
```

The full target layout — `query_shape/`, `scalar_query/`, `bridge/`,
`windows/`, `namespace/`, etc. — is documented in `DATA_TESTS.md` and
`decisions.yaml`; those directories don't exist on disk yet.

## Quick start

```bash
# From the repo root
pip install -e compliance/harness
pip install -e compliance/foundation

cd compliance/foundation

# List discovered tests without running them (no adapter needed).
# The 4 cross_grain/moderate cases show status "planned" — they're
# skipped by a real run until an adapter lands, unless you pass
# --include-planned.
python -m harness.runner --list --tests tests/ --include-planned

# Once an OSI implementation adapter exists (see ../ADAPTER_INTERFACE.md):
python -m harness.runner \
  --adapter adapters/osi_python_adapter.py \
  --tests tests/ \
  --datasets datasets/ \
  --include-planned
```

The harness ships under [`../harness/`](../harness/) and is installed
as the `osi_compliance_harness` package — every per-version suite under
`compliance/` shares this one runner / reporter / DB manager. The
harness's own mechanics (discovery, adapter invocation, row
comparison, reporting) are covered by its unit tests — see
[`../harness/README.md`](../harness/README.md).

## Per-test layout

Each test is a folder containing:

| File | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `metadata.yaml` | `id: T-NNN`, `decision: D-NNN`, `spec_refs`, `required_features`, `expected_error_code`, `xfail_reason` (if applicable). |
| `model.yaml` | The semantic model (typically a thin wrapper around a fixture from `datasets/f_*`). |
| `query.json` | The semantic query, in the new two-shape format (`dimensions` + `measures` for aggregation queries; `fields` for scalar queries). |
| `gold.sql` | A hand-written reference SQL query the harness executes against the fixture data to produce the expected row multiset. Treated by the harness as a row oracle, not as a SQL-string comparison — D-014 is per-engine, not cross-engine. |

Tests assert on observable behaviour only:

- `expected_error_code: E_<NAME>` ⇒ adapter must surface that code in
  stderr (substring match — see `compliance/harness/src/harness/runner.py`).
- The harness runs both `gold.sql` and the adapter's emitted SQL against
  the shared fixture and compares the resulting row multisets
  (order-insensitive unless the query has an `Order By`).

This means a `gold.sql` is a *witness* of the answer's shape and the
fixture data; the harness never compares SQL strings byte-for-byte
(per D-014, that's a per-engine concern).

## Decision coverage

Every `D-NNN` row in the Foundation spec should eventually have at
least one runnable case here. The mapping lives in `decisions.yaml`;
in this slice only `D-020` has one.
